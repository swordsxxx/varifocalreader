The Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America 
america 
When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. 
separation 
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. --Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world. 
world 
He has refused his assent to laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. 
good 
He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. 
them 
He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. 
only 
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. 
measures 
He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. 
people 
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise; the state remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

You have heard or giants in stories haven’t you? What makes someone a giant? Are they real or unreal? Do giants really have to be tall? They are all large and strong. Some are good, and some are bad. Oscar Wilde’s story is a beautiful parable of what makes people bad, and what makes them change.

Every afternoon, the children went and played in the Giant’s garden. It was a large and lovely garden with soft green grass and trees. After seven years. The Giant came back. He had been away, visiting his friend, the Cornish ogre. He saw the children playing in his garden. “How can they play in my garden?” he was wondering. |
So he built a wall all around it. He was indeed a very selfish giant. Now the poor children had nowhere to play. They tried to play on the road: but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones. They became unhappy. Then the spring came and an over the country there were little blossoms and little birds; but in the garden of the selfish giant it was still winter. 
winter 
One morning the giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music. It sounded very sweet to his ears. It was only a linnet singing outside the window. “I think the spring has come at last” said the giant; and he jumped out of his bed and looked out. There, he saw the most wonderful sight. 
sight 
Though a little hole in the wall the children had crept in; and they were sitting in the branches of the trees. In every tree that he could see there was a little child, and the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms. It was a lovely scene. 
scene 
But in one corner there was still winter. A little boy was standing under the tree. As he could not reach up to the branches, he was crying bitterly. And the giant’s heart melted as he looked out. “How selfish I have been”, he said. Now I know why the spring could not come here. I will that poor little boy on the top on the tree. Then I will knock down the wall and my garden shall be the children’s playground forever.” 
forever 
So he opened the door and crept downstairs. But when the children saw him, they were so frightened that they all ran away and the garden became winter once again. But the little boy did not run because his eyes were full of tears. He did not see the giant coming. And the giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hands and put him up into the tree. 
tree 
And at once the tree broke into blossom and the birds came and sang on it. The little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them around the giant’s neck and kissed him. The other children saw that the giant was no longer wicked and came back; and with them came the spring. “It is your garden now, little children” said the giant and he took a big and knocked down the wall. All day long they played and in the evening they came to the giant to bid him goodbye.

For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. 
whatsoever 
He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us. 
us 
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burned our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. 
people 
He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation. 
nation 
He has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands. 
hands 
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare, is undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. 
conditions 
In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. 
people 
Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends. 
friends 
We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.

My first duty on rising is to tender my most sincere and grateful thanks to the students of Madras for their address which they have just now presented to me…. There is no doubt whatever in my mind that if I could now go back once again to the days of my student hood, I would do so at once with pleasure. The life of a student is comparatively speaking, a sheltered life. There are, of course, certain responsibilities; they are definite and they are assigned to you by those who are willing to take care of you and there is not much need to be constantly exercising your own judgments. You know that in later life the position is reversed; instead of others helping you, you have in the first place to help yourself… Gentlemen, because this is the happy part of your life, there are certain responsibilities attached to it which must be well discharged by you, because no privilege in life is worth having, unless it is attended by corresponding duties and there are certain duties, which those who placed you in your present privileged position expect our to perform. 
perform 
I will consider these duties under four heads. First of all, the duty which you owe to yourselves; then there is the duty which you owe you fellow- students; the third duty is the which you owe to those in authority over you, and the last duty is a duty which you owe to those who are around you, not students, but people of the wider world. 
world 
Duty to yourselves 
yourselves 
The duty to you is twofold. You have first of all to lay by a stock of knowledge that will suffice you not sincerely for your examinations but will be helpful to you in later life. |Knowledge is an exacting mistress; she needs devotion, whole- hearted, on the part of the person who seeks her. Such whole0 hearted devotion is possible only in the days of student hood. Therefore, the first part of the duty towards yourselves is to take the utmost advantage of your present position, to lay by a stock of knowledge that will be useful to you in later life. 
life 
Importance of character 
character 
But it is not merely knowledge that will help any class of human beings by itself. Along with that knowledge there is another requisite that you must secure and that is character. It is almost a truism to say that more depends for success in life on character than on knowledge. It is an invidious thing to distinguish between comparative values of knowledge and character. But since both are indispensable, I would urge on you that you should attach as much importance to character as to knowledge. This character must show itself in earnestness, in energy of action and in high and generous sentiments being brought to bear upon the discharge of your duties and in recognizing what is due to yourselves. You have to acquire a character which will raise the whole life of the people amidst whom you move and for whom you are expected to work. 
work 
As character will naturally have to act on those around you, the stronger, the firmer and nobler it is, the better work you will do for the country. Even if you acquire a fairly high character while you are at school or college; it may not always be easy to retain that character in the struggles of later life, because you are sure to be acted upon by those who are around you. But if you begin by acquiring a strong character for yourselves and when you in course of time, occupy the place of the present seniors, then the students or the younger men of the succeeding generation will find that the forces that act on them are more helpful for retaining a good character than possibly what you may be able to find today. This is the twofold duty which you owe to yourselves – the acquiring of knowledge (I use ‘ knowledge ‘ in its widest sense) not only knowledge from every quarter which will be useful to you in later life- and acquiring character which will enable you to achieve success in whatever work you may take on hand. That, in brief, is the duty to you. 
THE FACE OF JUDAS ISCARIOT

Centuries ago a great artist was engaged to paint a mural for the cathedral in a Sicilian town. The subject was the life of Jesus. For many years the artist labored diligently and finally the painting was finished except for the two most important figures; the Child Jesus and Judas Iscariot. He searched far and wide 
for models for those two figures. 
figures 
One day while walking in an old part of the city he came upon some children playing in the street. Among them was a twelve year old boy whose face stirred the painter’s heart. It was the face of an angel-a very dirty one perhaps, but the face he needed. The artist took the child home with him, and day the boy sat patiently until the fact of the Child Jesus was finished. But the painter still found no one to serve as model for the portrait of Judas. For years, haunted by the fear that his masterpiece would remain unfinished, he continued his search. 
search 
The story of the unfinished masterpiece spread afar, and many men fancying themselves of wicked countenance, offered to pose as models for the face of Judas, but in vain. The old painter looked for a face that would serve to show Judas as he had envisioned him: a man warped by life, enfeebled by surrender to greed and lust.
